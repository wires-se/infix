	  Network route daemon. Manages static routes and RIP routing.
	  Reads configuration from /etc/netd/conf.d/*.conf.

	  With FRR: Full routing via gRPC (static routes, RIP, OSPF).
	  Without FRR: Standalone Linux backend via rtnetlink.

	  config and signals FRR to reload via frrinit.sh.

	  Provides full routing support (static routes, RIP, OSPF).
